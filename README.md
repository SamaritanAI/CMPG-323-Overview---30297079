## Branching Strategy
I will use a Gitflow branching strategy. This strategy excels in multiple releases each with their own deadlines. This strategy would simplify the process as most of the additional changes can be easily get their own releases and pulled into the main branch.
It will keep the management of the project simple and more manageable as it isn't overly complex.
I will have these brances:
- **main** branch
-  **feature** branches
- **hotfix** (to fix anything that might be configured incorrectly and learn something more convenient in class)

## Git Ignore

A `.gitignore` file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. this includes configuration files that are generated by IDEs (in this case, Visual Studio) that make the project work in different environments. This helps keep your repository clean and prevents unnecessary files from being tracked, like the above-mentioned files. I will also exclude files that store sensitive information such as passwords and API keys/tokens from being synchronised, to prevent data leaks.


## Submission strategies
Submissions will involve using a Microsoft Form where I will include necessary certificates and links to the github project. These will be private repositories so I will also add my lecturers as collaborators so that they can see my work and track my progress and grade it.

## Storage of sensitive information
I might use environment variables, on Heroku, to store sensitive information like API tokens so that even if that file is pushed by accident no sensitive information will be leaked.
